# KeepMood

KeepMood is an open source mood tracking app.
If you know Daylio, you might recognise this.

KeepMood actually shows you a daily graph!

I am currently in the process of implementing more graphs.

## Data
All data is stored on you own device in an SQLite database in this app's data folder.
No data is ever shared with anyone.

## Installing
KeepMood is not available in the Play Store, because I don't feel like paying.
I am planning to release on F-Droid and building release versions here on GitHub.
